# About
I'm looking for a career in software development.
I started programming in 2007 and never publicly shared my work.
Most of it is hot garbage because this was always just a hobby.
Over the next few months, I will be recovering projects that are over 15 years old.

My first program was a console version of BlackJack written in C# back in 2007 for a job interview at the company my dad worked at. I did not get the job.
From there I would compete in Google CodeJams and never got much further than a top 10% finish.
In college I tutored people in computer science that currently work for NASA.
I was later expelled from college for demostrating a vulnerability that I reported because the department chair asked me to. There was some miscommunication but Department Chair did advocate for me.

I have autism.
